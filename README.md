# CSS Learning Project

This project is a part of my journey to learn CSS. It's a simple webpage that mimics the look of an Amazon product page.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- [`index.html`](index.html): This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- [`style.css`](style.css): This file contains all the CSS styles used to style the webpage.
- `./images`: This directory contains all the images used in the project.

## Final Look

Here's a screenshot of the final look of the webpage:

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Use basic CSS properties like `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, etc.
- Style HTML elements using classes and ids.
- Use advanced CSS properties like `flexbox`, `grid`, `transform`, etc.
- Create responsive designs using media queries.


## How to Run

To view the webpage, simply open the [`index.html`](index.html) file in a web browser.
